          "content": "Hacks . Managing complexity | The project that we will be coding is called hangman and we will use python in order to code this. We will impoart random and the computer will auto generate a word from a dictionary file that we choose. It will choose a random word from the dictionary and will store it in the game. Then the player has to guess every word and if they guess wrong 10-15 times then they will loose the game, but if they guess the letters correctly with less than 15 mistakes they will win the game. . Procedural Abstraction | Some key objects of the user design would be getting an API contatining most of the words in the english dictionary and then another person can make the code extract a random word from the dictionary for the game. After another person can code the if statements of the player enetering the correct word and then it outputting the word into the game and then if the person inputs a wrong letter then it will show it is a wrong letter and subtract one from the count of errors. . Algorithm implementation | Some key aspects of the project is first finidng an API from the website and then putting it into the code. The next step is to create a function in order to extract a random word from the API, and we can import random and then do it from that After we have to create a counter for the mistakes and write if a player gets a letter guessed wrong then subtract the counter number by one and if the counter reaches 0, say &quot;Game over&quot; After we will create if statements for if the player gets the letter correct and if he guessed all the letters before the counter reaces 0, print the user wins the game. . Testing | We will run the code and check for any errors and we will preform the code iteration and testing as we move on. We will constantly run the lines to see if there are any errors with our code. If there are any errors we will fix them. We can put our data of all the words in the API, the dictionary will come from the API. We can ensure quality because we will use VSCode and import it to our fastapges and run the code and see if the quality is good. . .",
